### Matplotlib-Challenge

## General information
In this challenge I used Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and jupyter notebook to analyze, clean, and visualize a dataset. I started by cleaning and merging the two csv that I worked with both containg data about medicines used on mouse test subjects that have an effect on tumor sizes. After cleaning the data I began to visualize it in the form of bar charts, pie charts, summary statitcs, line plot, scatter plot and finally a linear regression model.
